# Frequent-Itemset-Mining-and-Association-Rule-Generation

This project implements a Python-based solution for mining frequent itemsets and generating association rules using the Apriori algorithm. It includes scripts (levelUp.py and arules.py) designed to handle different aspects of the process.

## Features:
- levelUp.py:
Mines frequent itemsets from transactional data.
Optimizes candidate generation for efficiency.

- arules.py:
Generates association rules based on frequent itemsets.
Utilizes Python for subset generation and rule validation.

## Key Achievements:
Implemented optimizations to reduce computational overhead in candidate generation.
Derived high-confidence association rules for actionable insights from transactional data.
